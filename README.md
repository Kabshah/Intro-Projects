# RPS
The user plays against the computer, and the game keeps track of wins, losses, and ties in a "score.txt" file.

Gameplay:

The player inputs their move by typing "rock", "paper", or "scissors" on shell/terminal.
The computer randomly selects its move.

The game determines the winner based on the classic rules which are:
Rock crushes Scissor, Scissors cuts Paper, Paper beats Rock.

To exit the game, type "exit".

Score Tracking:

The game records the results of each game in a file named "score.txt"(file is provided in this rep for demonstration). Each line in the file represents a game counter and includes the outcome (win/loss/tie) as well as the score of winner.

The game counter ends tracking when you type "exit" and resumes when you run the game again.
